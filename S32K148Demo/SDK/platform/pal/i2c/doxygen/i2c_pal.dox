   @brief Inter Integrated Circuit- Peripheral Abstraction Layer
   <p>
    The I2C PAL driver allows communication on an I2C bus. It was designed to be portable across all
    platforms and IPs which support I2C communication.
   </p>

   ## How to integrate I2C in your application ##
<p>
  I2C PAL modules need to include a configuration file named i2c_pal_cfg.h,
  which allows the user to specify which IPSs are used and how many resources
  are allocated for each of them (state structures).
  The following code example shows how to configure one instance for each
  available I2C IPs.

 @code
 #ifndef I2C_PAL_cfg_H
 #define I2C_PAL_cfg_H

 /* Define which IP instance will be used in current project */
 #define I2C_OVER_LPI2C
 #define I2C_OVER_FLEXIO
 #define I2C_OVER_I2C

 /* Define the resources necessary for current project */
 #define NO_OF_LPI2C_INSTS_FOR_I2C 2
 #define NO_OF_FLEXIO_INSTS_FOR_I2C 1
 #define NO_OF_I2C_INSTS_FOR_I2C 0
 #endif /* I2C_PAL_cfg_H */
 @endcode

 The following table contains the matching between platforms and available IPs
 IP/MCU |S32K142|S32K144|S32K148|MPC5748G|MPC5746C|
 -----: |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-------|
 LPI2C  |  YES  |  YES  |  YES  |   NO   |   NO   |
 FlexIO |  YES  |  YES  |  YES  |   NO   |   NO   |
  I2C   |  NO   |  NO   |  NO   |   YES  |   YES  |
<p>
<p>
  In order to use the I2C driver it must be first initialized in either master or slave mode,
  using functions I2C_MasterInit() or I2C_SlaveInit(). Once initialized, it cannot
  be initialized again for the same I2C module instance until it is de-initialized, using
  I2C_SlaveDeinit() or I2C_MasterDeinit. Different I2C module instances can work independently
  of each other.
</p>

<p>
  In each mode (master/slave) are available two types of transfers: blocking and non-blocking.
  The functions which initiate blocking transfers will configure the time out for transmission. If
  time expires the blocking functions will return STATUS_TIMEOUT and transmission will be aborted.
  The blocking functions are: I2C_MasterSendDataBlocking, I2C_MasterReceiveDataBlocking,
  I2C_SlaveSendDataBlocking and I2C_SlaveReceiveDataBlocking.
</p>

<p>
  Slave Mode provides functions for transmitting or receiving data to/from any I2C master. There are two
  slave operating modes, selected by the field <tt>slaveListening</tt> in the slave configuration structure:
   - Slave always listening: the slave interrupt is enabled at initialization time and the slave always
   listens to the line for a master addressing it. Any events are reported to the application through the
   callback function provided at initialization time.
   - On-demand operation: the slave is commanded to transmit or receive data through the call of
   I2C_SlaveSendData() and I2C_SlaveReceiveData() (or their blocking counterparts). The actual moment of the
   transfer depends on the I2C master.
</p>

<p>
  The configuration structure includes a special field named extension. It will be used only for I2C
  transfers over FLEXIO and should contain a pointer to extension_flexio_for_i2c_t structure.
  The purpose of this structure is to configure which FLEXIO pins are used by the applications and
  their functionality (SDA and SCL).
 <p>

  ## Important Notes ##
<p>
  - The I2C transfers could be done using interrupts and DMA mode.
  - FlexIO driver only supports master mode.
  - The driver enables the interrupts for the corresponding module, but any interrupt priority
    setting must be done by the application.
